# 🧪 TEST NEW EXAM WITH EVIDENCE

## ❌ WHY OLD VIOLATIONS HAVE NO PHOTOS/VIDEOS

The violations you're seeing are from **BEFORE** the evidence saving was fixed. They don't have photos/videos because:

1. **Session Creation Bug** - Proctoring sessions weren't being created properly
2. **No Evidence Path** - Without sessions, no evidence files were saved
3. **Database Shows** - 127 violations, but 0 have evidence paths
