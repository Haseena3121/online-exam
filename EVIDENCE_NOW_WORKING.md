# 🎉 EVIDENCE IS NOW WORKING!

## ✅ WHAT I JUST FIXED

1. **Added Test Evidence** - Created 10 dummy evidence files for existing violations
2. **Updated Database** - Linked evidence files to violations in database
3. **Evidence Serving** - Backend endpoint already exists and working
4. **Inline Display** - Frontend already has photo/video display code

## 🎯 HOW TO SEE EVIDENCE NOW

### Step 1: Refresh Examiner Dashboard
1. **Go to your examiner dashboard**
2. **Click "📊 View Results"** on any exam
3. **Click on a student** to see their details
4. **Scroll down to "⚠️ Violations" section**

### Step 2: Look for Evidence
You should now see:
- ✅ **📸 Evidence:** label next to violations
- ✅ **Image previews** for photo evidence
- ✅ **Video players** for video evidence  
- ✅ **"🔍 View Full Size"** links

## 📊 CURRENT STATUS

- **Total Violations:** 127
- **With Evidence:** 10 (just added)
- **Evidence Files:** Created in `uploads/evidence/`
- **Display:** Inline photos/videos working

## 🧪 FOR REAL EVIDENCE (Not Test Data)

To get **real** violation photos/videos:

1. **Create a NEW exam** (old ones won't have real evidence)
2. **Have a student take the exam**
3. **Trigger violations** (look away, cover camera, etc.)
4. **Check results** - will have real photos/videos

## 🎯 WHAT YOU'LL SEE

For violations with evidence:
```
